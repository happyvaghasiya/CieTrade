                    <h2 className="text-red-600 py-2">July 5, 2016 / <a href={'/Blogg'} className="hover:text-gray-700">Blog</a></h2>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3 italic ">David Haber, President of cieTrade Systems Inc., reviews several worthwhile questions for recyclers to ask when they shop for software.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3">Faced with competitive markets, volume and quality demands and new shipping regulations, recyclers of recovered fiber and other materials increasingly appreciate the value of operating with specialized business software.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3">These systems are designed to handle the workflow, business processes, documentation needs and other requirements that are common to recycling companies that collect, pack or broker commodities, helping ownership achieve goals such as increased productivity, improved decision making and greater oversight of their businesses.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3">Unfortunately, choosing the right solution is no easy task, especially with the numerous offerings in the marketplace and the multitude of features to sort through. To help recyclers choose the right software for their business, here are seven important questions to consider before making a final decision.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3 font-bold">1. Does the software meet your “core” business needs?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3">You would think this would be common sense, but it’s surprising how often decision makers get distracted by demo showmanship or bells and whistles. Choosing the right solution begins with identifying your critical business processes and requirements and separating them from features or functions of lesser importance. Whether it is inventory control, workflow, documentation or accounting, it’s important to start with a prioritized list of what you expect the software to do.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3 font-bold"> 2. Is the system easy to use, and what do current customers say?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3">Choosing a solution that’s logical and intuitive to work with will deliver the productivity gains and customer service improvements fundamental to achieving your business objectives. If your staff is left with the impression that the new system is too difficult to work with, their frustration and lack of support can easily spill over into unexpected training and implementation problems.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3">Every software vendor provides references, and speaking with them can be helpful. You also should consider the scale and reputation of a vendor’s references. Larger companies may tend to apply greater resources to their software evaluation process and, it’s worth noting, have a lot more at stake if they choose the wrong solution. Conversely, references that are known to have a poor reputation in the industry can call into question the credibility of an endorsement. Always ask the software provider who their largest customers are and how long they’ve been using their product. Chances are the credibility of the references and the similarity of their businesses to your own will say a lot about whether their software is right for you.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3 font-bold">3. Will it adapt to changing business needs?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3">It’s important to consider not only the features you need today but also those you might need in the future. Many of the systems specifically marketed to the recycling industry have a tendency to be functionally strong in some areas like scrap buy-back or packing plant operations, but then may be weak in others like material processing, inventory control or brokerage.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3">Purchasing business software is a long-term investment. It’s important to consider whether it will be able to support the changing needs of your business and help you pursue new opportunities as they arise.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3">Scalability is not only about handling increasing numbers of users or transaction volumes. It’s also about whether the product will offer the kind of features you might need as your business grows and if the vendor’s support team has the knowledge and experience to meet the increasing demands.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3">It also is important to find out what’s involved with performing a software upgrade, who is responsible for doing it and whether it’s something you can easily do yourself.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3 font-bold">4. Does the accounting model (really) work?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3">One of the advantages of working with recycling business software is having access to specialized reports like gross profit, commissions or inventory that would otherwise be difficult to get from your accounting system. But relying on these reports can also be a problem if they don’t reflect the sales or purchases reported in your accounting system.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3">The trouble is that many software solutions rely on batch files to manually upload transactions to your accounting package. This makes it easier to integrate with a variety of products, but can potentially lead to variances. Batch files can be mishandled and subject to posting errors that can result in missing transactions. When variances do occur, accounting for the differences can be a long and tedious process, especially if there is no easy way to distinguish between the direct postings by end users from batch uploads.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3">For recycling systems that calculate profit or track inventory costs, it’s important to look at not only the process of transferring sales and expenses to accounting but also how easily the accounts being posted to can be reconciled, and whether any tools are available to make this job easier.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3 font-bold "> 5. How will it provide ROI?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3">For many recyclers the true cost of introducing business software is not only the license fees or the training costs, but also the commitment of time, dedication of resources and the potential disruption through the implementation process. Thus, it is crucial to consider what kind of return on investment (ROI) you can expect from your new business system.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3">The following is a list of some typical ROI factors you should look for in any software solution:</p>
                    <div className="ps-4">
                        <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-2">Eliminating Redundancy – Look for features that can help avoid the use of spreadsheets, manual document preparation or other functions that can involve duplicate data entry or maintenance.</p>
                        <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-2">Avoiding Errors – Does the software offer features that can catch user errors like incorrect pricing or weights or overpayments to vendors?</p>
                        <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-2">Workflow Features – Are there workflow features or tools that will allow your operation to collaborate better and improve the tracking of critical business activities such as shipping status, booking cutoffs or received mill weights? Also, look for opportunities to tie into data feeds or EDI services to further eliminate manual entry.</p>
                        <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-2">Visibility – Consider how increasing the visibility (and central access) of business information might impact productivity and oversight.</p>
                        <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-2">Reducing Dependencies – Will the software help introduce standard procedures that will make it easier to train new personnel and minimize dependencies on outside accountants or consultants?</p>
                        <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-2">Value-added Features – Does the solution have features that can provide added value to relationships such as mobile app or a “self-service” web portal that might also reduce emails requests and calls from clients? Are there any mobile device or Web-based apps that can help improve productivity of your team, especially when working from remote locations?</p>
                    </div>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3 font-bold">7. How long will it take to go live?</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3">Successful business software projects will often demand a considerable amount of time and effort, usually over the course of several weeks or even months. You’ll have a lot at stake implementing a business system for your recycling company. Before going forward, it’s vital to understand the time commitments and the expectations needed to ensure a successful transition.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3">Choosing a software system to help manage your recycling business doesn’t have to be difficult, but it’s important to recognize that not every product excels at doing everything. When you’re looking at solutions stay focused on what your business really needs today and think about what it might need in the future.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3">Make sure the partner you choose comes with experience and success stories that are relevant to companies like yours. Most importantly, make sure you understand the value and return on investment that a potential business system can deliver. Avoid making judgments solely on cost, because more often than not that’s a sure way to end up making the wrong choice</p>
