                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3"><b className="text-zinc-500">Norwalk, CT — September 25th</b> — cieTrade Systems Inc., a leader in global business management software for bulk commodity export trading and for the recycling industry, announces the upcoming launch of its Automated Booking ETA Update Service. This new feature is designed to meet the needs of exporters by providing real-time updates on the estimated time of arrival (ETAs) for ocean carrier bookings and, in the future, offering track and trace capabilities for individual containers.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3">cieTrade developed this new service in response to much client interest to enhance logistics management, and notification of container shipments. Participating clients will benefit from receiving fully automated ETA updates for open bookings for supported ocean carriers. This feature is an extension of cieTrade’s existing support for international trade which already includes electronic BOL submissions and automated booking requests and confirmations through their longstanding partnership with INFOR NEXUS.</p>
