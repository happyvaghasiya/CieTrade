                    <p className="text-gray-500 py-3"><b className="text-zinc-600">Stamford, CT,  July 31, 2019</b>— Effectively leveraging information technology has become critical to the success of paper, scrap and commodity exporters of all sizes, especially with today’s increasing customer demands, growing transaction volumes, logistical challenges, and exacting documentation requirements.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 py-3">cieTrade, a global provider of business software for international commodity trading and brokerage, provides comprehensive solutions that can organize workflow, automate tasks, and improve decision making with greater visibility and control over activity and profitability.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 py-3">Their new SaaS cloud software, <a href={'/'}>cieTrade.net</a>, builds on their success by offering SMB commodity brokers and exporters a cost-effective alternative to customizing ERP systems and building home-grown solutions, providing the specialized tools they need to manage and control their business. Being cloud-based, there’s no expensive hardware to buy or software to install. Customers are always on the current version and can scale their usage with business demand. Your staff can work from anywhere using only a browser and Internet access, an ideal setup for traders with overseas offices or traveling agents. For many trading companies, the most difficult part with new software is overcoming the challenges with the “onboarding” process. With our knowledge of these difficulties, cieTrade helps make this easier by including services, initial training, and document customization into the initial subscription price to facilitate the transition and maximize client success.</p>
