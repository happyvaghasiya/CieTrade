                    <h2 className="text-red-600 py-2">April 2, 2019  / <a href={'/Productupdate'} className="hover:text-gray-700">Product Updates</a></h2>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3">cieTrade’s new productivity tool allows you to efficiently manage service contracts with waste haulers or other third-parties while eliminating spreadsheet workarounds.  </p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3">The new Service Contract Module lets you set up one or more service agreements between a hauler and any service location. These contracts can be retrieved based on account, site, provider, contract date or expiration. </p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3">Email alerts can be generated based on upcoming contract expiration and even for price escalations. As part of this change, the cieTrade Location form now shows a list of related service contracts as well as any equipment at that location, making it even easier to view and access this information in cieTrade.</p>
                    <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg py-3">The Service Contract Module is available in the latest cieTrade update as of April 1st. The accompanying email alert feature is available for free but only upon request due to pending configuration.</p>
