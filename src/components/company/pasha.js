In their continued commitment to embrace new technology and introduce leading-edge techniques to speed up and refine their operations, Pasha Recycling sought a comprehensive software that could provide complete traceability throughout their supply chain.</h6></div>

                                <h6 className='text-lg text-gray-500'>As with any company that’s heavily relied on spreadsheets to manage their operation, implementing a new business management platform was a significant step for Pasha Recycling. After speaking to several solution providers based within the UK and finding that their platforms predominantly supported fleet operations and service collections, cieTrade stood out as the only specialized solution that could support their company’s business model. More importantly, they saw the value of a comprehensive platform supported by a strong team with years of experience in the recycling industry. Together, cieTrade and Pasha Recycling completed an extensive workflow analysis in order to determine whether the platform could successfully meet their business needs. The absence of pressure throughout the evaluation process also allowed them enough time to feel confident in their decision when the time came to move forward and commit to a system. Ultimately, Pasha Recycling’s experience with cieTrade’s business development team made the handoff to their support team a seamless process.</h6>

In their kick-off call with cieTrade’s support team, Pasha Recycling was provided detailed data upload files to simplify the process of uploading their customer and supplier records, product list and more into their new database. The team frequently reached out to cieTrade to confirm all fields were being filled out correctly, saving them time and minimizing errors as they completed each file. The communication between Pasha Recycling and cieTrade’s support team also helped them adhere to the upload deadlines that were initially outlined, ensuring that their training schedule remained on track.</h6>

                                <h6 className='text-lg text-gray-500 py-2'>Given the time zone difference between the two companies, receiving ample support throughout the onboarding and training process was crucial to Pasha Recycling’s team. According to the company’s Marketing, Branding and New Business Development Manager Kiran Singh, cieTrade made arranging training and support sessions at times that were convenient for his team simple and hassle-free. “We usually set up our sessions at around 10:00 AM eastern time, which is 3:00 PM here in the UK, and it was perfect because that’s the time that tends to quiet down for us. Never once was it too difficult to arrange sessions on the days or times that were best suited for us.”</h6>

                                <h6 className='text-lg text-gray-500 py-2'>In setting up their training schedule, cieTrade arranged Pasha Recycling’s sessions to follow the order in which the team would operate the system after their go-live date. Training kicked off with several sessions with their booking team, covered scale receiving, inventory management, container shipping and finally ended with accounting. At the end of each session, cieTrade’s support team allotted time for their team to ask questions on the topics they had covered. This method allowed Pasha Recycling to see their workflow from start to finish, making it easier to understand how they would be utilizing the system every day. Before long, Pasha Recycling became comfortable enough with the system that they were able to hold their own internal system refresher sessions in the event that someone on their team needed additional training.</h6>

                                <h6 className='text-lg text-gray-500 py-2'>cieTrade made sure Pasha Recycling had an abundance of resources in addition to their weekly sessions. According to their team, every single session was followed up with an email, help articles and a video recording of the training. Pasha Recycling was then able to leverage these additional resources by combining the recorded training sessions and help file articles to create a personalized training program that could be referenced at any time by their team. If any questions or concerns came up, they were either answered directly in the session or the support team called or emailed moments after the meeting, meaning updates rarely had to be chased. Even after Pasha Recycling’s training schedule concluded, cieTrade’s support team was present for any matters that arose. The support team’s level of commitment was especially helpful once they’d finally reached the point of integrating their weigh-bridge scales, offering multiple calls during which Pasha Recycling’s team alternated a number of weights on their scale until they were able to set up a successful connection.</h6>

Especially as they got closer to their go-live date, Pasha Recycling appreciated cieTrade’s effort to assist with any urgent matters that arose, even in instances that occurred out of business hours. Ultimately, the support team’s genuine interest in their questions and concerns played a significant role in the success of their implementation process.</h6>
